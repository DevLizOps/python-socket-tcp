## Overview

This project sets up a basic client-server model using TCP sockets in Python to facilitate communication between two processes on the same machine.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed on your machine

### Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/LizzyMaken/python-socket-tcp.git
    cd python-socket-tcp-client-server
    ```

2. Ensure Python 3 is installed:
    ```sh
    python3 --version
    ```

## Running the Application

### Starting the Server

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `server.py`.
2. Run the server script:
    ```sh
    python3 server.py
    ```

### Starting the Client

1. Open another terminal and navigate to the directory containing `client.py`.
2. Run the client script:
    ```sh
    python3 client.py
    ```

## Testing Communication

Follow the prompts on both the server and client to send and receive messages, verifying that the communication works correctly.
